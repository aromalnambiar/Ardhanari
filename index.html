            <strong>My Dear Pappu ❤️🌙,</strong><br><br>
            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;">After reading your letter, my heart felt something I can’t even explain properly. I kept smiling like a fool… because knowing that someone like you feels for me the way I feel for you that is something rare 💌✨<br><br>
            Your eyes… they remind me of a cat 🐱 sharp, expressive, full of attitude and mystery. And your face… it shines like the moon 🌙 calm, glowing, peaceful, yet powerful. You don’t just look beautiful… you feel beautiful.<br><br>
            You know how much I love BMW 🚘 the power in its engine, the class in its design, the bold and aggressive beauty it carries with confidence on every road. And when I see you, I feel that same energy. Strong. Elegant. Fearless. Rare. But still soft in the right moments.<br><br>
            The most beautiful part? We both love BMW. Maybe that’s why our mindset connects differently we both admire strength with class, power with control, and beauty with attitude 😌🔥<br><br>
            But Pappu… what I feel for you is beyond comparisons.</p>

            But Pappu… what I feel for you is beyond comparisons.<br><br>
            When I think about us, I think about Shiva and Parvati 🕉️❤️ two powerful souls, different energies, but when united, they become complete. Like Ardhanarishwara half Shiva, half Shakti not two separate beings, but one balanced existence.<br><br>
            That is how I see us.<br><br>
            Not just lovers.<br>
            Not just business partners.<br>
            But two energies growing together.<br>
            Supporting each other.<br>
            Balancing each other.<br>
            Becoming stronger together.<br><br>
            You are my calm when I am restless.<br>
            You are my fire when I feel low.<br>
            You are my strength and my softness at the same time.<br><br>
            Even when you get angry 😤❤️, you look beautiful to me. Because your anger shows your passion. Your fire shows your spirit. And I admire that about you so much.<br><br>
            We are not just a couple.<br>
            We are becoming something deeper.<br>
            Something pure.<br>
            Something strong.<br>
            Something divine.<br><br>
            For me, our love is not just attraction.<br>
            It feels like the purest form of love where there is respect, ambition, partnership, loyalty, and dreams 🌙✨<br><br>
            You are not just my crush anymore.<br>
            You are someone I see in my future.<br>
            Someone I want to build with.<br>
            Someone I want to grow with.<br><br>
            And one more thing… everything I wrote here is from my heart ❤️ These are my feelings, my words, my thoughts. I just used a little help to fix grammar and make it more clear 😄 So if this sounds too perfect, don’t worry the emotions are 100% mine.<br><br>
            My Pappu… my moon 🌙<br>
            My fire 🔥<br>
            My partner 🤝<br>
            My Shakti ❤️<br><br>
            <strong>Always yours,<br>
            With all my heart 💞✨</strong>
